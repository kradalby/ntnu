Google Spanner uses timestamps for everything. It acutally stores the data on the format <key:value, timestamp:int64>, which one can say is a deep and important integration.

First, the time implementation in Spanner, known as TrueTime (TT), is a clock that is fetched from GPS and Atomic clocks. The TT.now() function returns the current time, but in a slightly unconventional way. The current time is a interval between the earliest possible time and the latest possible time the current time can be, covering the possible inaccurecy of the time in to account.

The .now is complemented with .after and .before which returns True if the time given is guaranteed after or before, respectivly.

The user of the intervals will make spanner slow down to make sure that there is no local time conflict with the global time system and therefore provide a reliable timestamp for each transaction.
