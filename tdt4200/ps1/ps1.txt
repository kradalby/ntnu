## Part 1 - Theory

### Problem 1 - General Theory

a)

Flynn's Taxonomy:

**SISD**: Single Instruction Single Datastream describes a system what can only do one instruction at the time, and all data is received from the same stream. A machine with one CPU and one main memory will fitt here, like the classic von Neumann.

**SIMD**: Single Instruction Multiple Datastream describes a system which can do the same single instruction on multiple ALUs, with each ALU working on different data. A GPU is a good example of a SIMD implementation.

**MISD**: Multiple Instruction Single Datastream describes a system where multiple ALUs/functional units perform different operations on the same data. This is not a widely used architecture.

**MIMD**: Multiple Instruction Multuple Datastream describes a system where all the different processors/ALUs can function independently. Each processor can work on different instructions and different datastreams.

MPI fits into Flynn's Taxonomy within SIMD and MIMD. MPI is used for sending messages between the different instances of the instruction/program. It is not however needed in MISD and SISD.
