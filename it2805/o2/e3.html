    <p>The focus in this course is on the World Wide Web as a platform for interactive applications, content publishing and social services. The development of web-based applications requires knowledge about the underlying technology and the formats and standards the web is based upon. In this course you will learn about the HTTP communication protocol, the markup languages HTML, XHTML and XML, the CSS and XSLT standards for formatting and transforming web content, event-based programming on the client-side, interactive graphics and multimedia content on the web. The course will also give an introduction in web search and indexing as well as information management aspects such as digital rights and standards for describing web content</p>

    <p>The subject starts with a description of problem solving methods by means of heuristic search. Therafter, various knowledge representation languages and inference methods for automatic problem solving. Representation in form of predicate logic, frames and semantic nets are treated, and connected to the main forms of reasoning - especially rule based reasoning. Furthermore, architectures that integrates various resoning methods, agent based architectures and architectures for interactive problem solving. Numerous applicaton examples are given to demonstrate the methods.</p>
